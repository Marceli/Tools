                     ***WARNING***
EDITING THE REGISTRY CAN RENDER YOUR COMPUTER UNUSABLE. 
UNLESS YOU ARE 100% CERTAIN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, 
YOU ARE ADVICED NOT TO MODIFY IT IN ANY WAY.
--------------------------------------------------------


A. HOW TO MAKE XPLORER² YOUR DEFAULT FOLDER APPLICATION

During installation you have the opportunity to replace your windows explorer with xplorer², by ticking the respective box in the Additional Tasks page. It is recommended that you _don't_ tick the "Use separate single pane window for integration" box. Then the same xplorer² window will be used for all your folders.

If you want some slightly different command line options you can add any of the supported switches (see the quickstart guide) editing this registry key:

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\open\command]
@="C:\Program Files\zabkat\xplorer2\xplorer2_uc.exe" /S:x2solo /1 /N /M /T "%1"

If you want to reuse an existing xplorer² window see the bSingleWindow tweak below.

To relinquish folder control to windows explorer without uninstalling xplorer² use the menu command Tools > Options, switch to Advanced page and click on "Undo explorer replacement" button. If this doesn't work you must start xplorer² as the true administrator so it has enough rights to write to HKLM.


P.S. For more information on this topic (and explanations why My Computer cannot be opened in x2) please consult this discussion: http://www.netez.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5669 where you'll see other registry keys you need to change as described above for fuller integration (e.g. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Drive)



B. TWEAKING ADVANCED SETTINGS FOR XPLORER²

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: There is a GUI tool that allows you to edit all these options so you
	don't need to hack your registry. Check your installation folder for
	x2SettingsEditor (or use the Start menu shortcut). 
	Or use Tools > Advanced options menu command. This is how it looks:
	http://zabkat.com/pic/guireg.png

	x2SettingsEditor /A to edit the ANSI/lite options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


The main registry key is: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ZabaraKatranemia Plc\xplorer2 — or xplorer2_UC if you have the unicode version installed. Whenever you want to change a value, follow these steps:

* EXIT all running instances of xplorer² (this is essential)
* Start regedit using Start | Run (or equivalent)
* Locate the main key where xplorer² keeps its settings
* Double-click on a "variable" name to change its value

Most options have self-descriptive names, so it shouldn't be hard to imagine what each variable does. As a general further hint, names that begin with 'b' (e.g. bUnderline) refer to on/off (boolean) settings. Setting the value to 0 turns the option off, any other value enables it. Names starting with 'n' imply a number of some sort, and those with 'sz' are strings. Hungarian people talk like that, alledgedly <g>.

Names that start with "bin" imply values that are made up as the sum of individual bits. Please sum up all the numbers representing the options you want and set this total number to the "bin" value.

Values that correspond to time intervals are measured in milli-seconds. So if you want to set one to 2 sec, set it to 2000.


Here's a description of settings you may want to experiment with, organized by subkey. A [*] next to a value below stands for the default setting. Whenever you want to reset a value, just delete it altogether. When changing values, make sure you switch to decimal (not hex) input mode in regedit.

File types
List of comma-separated wildcards that correspond to each file type, e.g. audio, video etc. You can extend a category by editing its content and adding (or removing) the wildcards to taste. You can even add categories of your own; just add a new string (REG_SZ) value, give it a descriptive name and fill it with the wildcards that define it.

Find Blacklist
Full paths to folders you want excluded from being searched by "Find files" — they won't be flattened either. You can add extra trouble-making folders as necessary. If you remove any folders, please make sure the remaining list has consecutive folder numbering. The easiest solution is to rename the last folder to the ordinal of the folder you deleted.

Transformation rules
If you want more default rules for Mark | Check build, please add them here.


[xplorer2(_UC)] //////////////////////

NAME              VALUE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
nKBSizeDecimals   1[*] How many decimals to show for compressed mode sizes, eg 1.01kb vs 1.006kb
bSortZipAsFiles   0: as folders 1: as files[*] (when zipfolders are supported)
nFocusTimeoutMS   500[*] timeout (in millisec) affecting the previewer and tree autoupdates
                  The default is to wait 0.5 sec before e.g loading a file's preview, giving
                  you time to scroll without loading previews for each file you come across.
nHoverTimeoutMS   1000[*] likewise this is the time you have to hover on a tab or tree node
                  while dragging, before x2 automatically opens the tab or tree node.
nRefreshTimeoutMS 500[*] delay between receipt of filesystem change and actual pane refresh
                  too small values will wastefully refresh views too often bogging down the CPU
nCopyThrottleMS   0[*] optional MS delay introduced to slow down robust transfers
                  saves on system resource use but makes copies slower; small values (<500) recommended
rgbFolderLinkcol  RGB color for hilighting the active subpath in pane titlebars [-1 for default]
rgbActiveBgcol    RGB color overriding the white background of active folder panes [-1 for default]
rgbFilterBgcol    RGB color override for folder panes with an active visual filter [-1 for default]

szExtFindFiles    path for external find files program [default is explorer] e.g. c:\tools\finder "%s"
                  "%s" should be included; the current folder path is passed as an argument there
                  (this option is only available for the lite version)
bSingleWindow     0[*] If 1 then only one window is used for all folders, even when you launch/clone
                  a separate x2 instance. If set to 2, then a new tab will be opened.
                  (if this value doesn't exist just create it as a REG_DWORD)
binFileOpFlags    0[*] bitfield with options for file copies initiated through drag-drop or Paste
                  FOF_NOCONFIRMATION would result in no file overwrite warnings etc
szNewFileExt      Optional extension for NewFile (F7) command, e.g. "txt" will create text files
nThumbSpacing     3[*] How many pixels to leave between each thumbnail; set 0 for default spacing
nThumbMini100     60[*] How much % smaller is the mini-thumb compared to the normal thumbnail view mode
nCodePage         1253[*] Custom codepage for text file encoding used for Mark > Containing text menu

	GIOPT_NOKEYSENDMS 1024 /* disallow <Ctrl+S> sending items to mini-scrap pane */
	GIOPT_NOPOSHREFRESH 4096 /* turn off the "modern" refresh system; should be used with GIOPT_ALTAREFRESH */
	GIOPT_ADDRBARENDOK 8192 /* addressbar will activate as you select an item from history list (ENTER not required) */
	GIOPT_DIREXTENSIONS 16384 /* enables filename "extensions" for folders (past the dot) */
	GIOPT_PROTECT1SEL 65536 /* "eat first click" option will protect even single item selections */
	GIOPT_ROBUSTPASTE 131072 /* implement Edit | Paste command robustly, no explorer */
	GIOPT_CACHETHUMBS 524288 /* items cache their preview bitmaps (not recommended!) */

	GIOPT_PACKEDTHUMBS 536870912 /* tight thumbnail spacing mode; no room for name underneath */


bSantasLittleHelper
This controls whether x2 uses a background thread to do time-consuming tasks like thumbnail extraction etc. To turn it off set it to 0 (not recommended). A value of 2 (default) uses the background thread but running at a lower priority so as not to interfere with the main program. If you find that the columns take ages to fill up (especially when other programs are running) you may set bSantasLittleHelper to 1 and it will run at the same priority level as the main program.
